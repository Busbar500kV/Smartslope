Synthetic data and algorithms for radar-based slope movement detection - by යසස් පොන්වීර


# Smartslope

Synthetic data generation and algorithm prototyping
for ground-based radar slope movement monitoring.

This repository contains tools to:
- Generate synthetic coherent radar measurements for planned installations
- Model motion scenarios (creep, accelerating creep, steps)
- Simulate noise, phase drift, and dropouts
- Provide baseline datasets for algorithm development
